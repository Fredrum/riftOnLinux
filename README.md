# riftOnLinux
Getting Oculus Rift CV1 to work on Linux. Currently on Raspberry Pi 4b and Ubuntu 22.04.

This is a work in progress and its possible that some steps are actually not required.
I'll update as I'll figure out more.

If you have any information that you think might help please add an 'Issue' to let me know!


Current Steps:

1.  Copy the file 83-hmd.rules to
/etc/udev/rules.d/
